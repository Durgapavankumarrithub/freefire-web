              <h1 style="color:red;">Welcome to the freefire world</h1>
                <p>The game features two main game modes: Battle Royale and Clash Squad. In Battle Royale, 50 players are dropped onto an island and must fight to be the last one standing. Clash Squad is a team-based mode where two teams of 4 players fight each other in a best-of-5 match. Free Fire features a variety of weapons, items, and vehicles that players can use to survive. The game also has a system of playable characters with unique skills.</p>
  <p>The Battle Royale mode in Free Fire accommodates up to 52 players landing on an island without weapons. They must fight to be the last one standing by scavenging weapons and equipment from buildings. Playing this mode in ranked mode will affect their ranking. There are 6 maps to choose from: Bermuda, Bermuda Remastered, Kalahari, Purgatory, Alpine, and NeXTerra. The mode allows for solo, duo, or squad play.</p>    
  <p>Clash Squad is a 4-player versus 4-player mode where players purchase weapons and items from an in-game shop during preparation time, then engage in combat against the opposing team. The mode is played in a best-of-7 format, lasting anywhere from 4 to 7 rounds. Each round is won when all players from one team are killed, either by their opponents or through environmental factors. As of 2022, the maps used in Clash Squad are the same as those in Battle Royale mode. The mode can be played as either Ranked or Casual.</p>

            <h1 style="color:orange;">Character system</h1>
            <p>Free Fire features a character system of 50+ characters. Each character has a unique skill which can be active or passive. Active skills can be triggered manually by an in-game button and passive skills are triggered automatically. Each character can equip 4 skills including the character's skill and 3 skills from other characters (one active skill and three passive skills can be equipped by a single character).[24] Free Fire characters have unique backstories. A few of these characters were inspired by real-life celebrities whom Free Fire had collaborations with, such as Chrono from the collaboration with Cristiano Ronaldo,[25] Dimitri & Thiva from the collaboration with Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike,[26] A-Patroa from the collaboration with Anitta,[27] Alok from the collaboration with DJ Alok[28] and JBeibs from the collaboration with Justin Bieber.[29] In the game, it is possible to acquire all characters by using gold, an in-game currency that can be earned through gameplay and event participation, or with Diamonds which can be bought with real-world currency.</p>

          <h1 style="color:blue;">Pet System</h1>
          <p>In Free Fire, pets can provide support to players during fights. As of 2023, the game features 21 different pets that players can choose to bring into battle. Each pet has a special ability that sets it apart from the others. Some of these abilities are passive and trigger automatically, while others are active and require manual activation. One of the pets in the game, Poring, was added as part of a collaboration with Ragnarok Online. Players can also customize their pets with skins and emotes.</p>
          <p>These are in-game NPC characters that follow their users around and assist them with their skills. These pets have abilities just like how different characters have their own passive and active skills. Pets are unique to Free Fire as the skills they possess can have a real impact on the outcome of your fights.

         <p>Lone Wolf is a variation of the Clash Squad mode that can be played as either a 1-player versus 1-player or 2-player versus 2-player "duo" format with more intricate rules. In each round, both sides have the opportunity to select their equipment for the next 2 rounds. The game is played in a best-of-5 format. If both teams have won 4 rounds each, a final round begins with both sides able to choose any weapon they prefer. All players are automatically equipped with basic items such as a vest and helmet from the start of the round. This mode takes place on its own map known as Iron Dome.</p>
